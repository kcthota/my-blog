## Hello World!

It's been a while since I last wrote a blog post. Following my stint as a startup founder, I've been immersed in some fascinating new projects, and I look forward to sharing them with you here.

When I decided to set up this new blog, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to use AI to help build it. That experiment ultimately led me to build a brand new framework called [**Vending Mocha**](https://vendingmocha.com). 

Vending Mocha is a simple, blazing-fast, SSG-powered blogging framework designed for effortless deployment to platforms like GitHub Pages and Cloudflare Pages. Publishing is as straightforward as creating a new Markdown file and checking it into Git.

Beyond building out the framework, I've been learning and experimenting with AI. I plan to share more of those insights and learnings in my upcoming posts. Stay tuned!
